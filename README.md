# paper_show_by_claude
This is a website to show papers. The code for website is completely created by Claude 3 with natural language prompt.
It may make mistakes, but after long-time tuning the prompts, we can get a code that can run.
For a task with a long logic, it can not perform well.

There are two admins:
    1: admin: super admin, can add and delete. pwd: admin
    2: admin2: normal admin, can add but not delete. pwd: admin2

Password can be generate through generate_password_hash.php

You can view the web in https://c2sml.cn/paper/ (https sometimes does not work, but it is safe to continue.)
